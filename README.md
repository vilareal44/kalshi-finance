## App architecture

This app uses a simple architecture propoused by "Very Good Ventures" through their "very_good_cli" command line interface. It uses the Bloc Library and 3 layers to easily separate the responsibilities of every part of the code (see example image bellow).

- **Presentation layer:** The presentation layer is located at the `/lib` folder
- **Domain layer:** The domain layer is composed by `wellness_repository` subpackages located at `/packages` folder
- **Data layer:** The data layer would be composed by `client` or `api` for external data access. Data layer packages should be create as subpackages at `/packages` folder.

Widgets:
